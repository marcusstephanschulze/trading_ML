# trading_ML

*** Undergoing development

Goal of this project is two fold: 
1) create robust data pipelines that consistently refresh and populate tables with processed data, which feeds an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard.
2) Investigate the effectiveness of supervised categorisation ML models, while enhancing the data with a series of industry-used stock performance indicators (stochastic, momentum, etc.)
   Potential to create 'weightings' on the success of different indicators (and their associated variables) within different sectors and 'back-propagate' to adjust the weightings as the data progresses.
